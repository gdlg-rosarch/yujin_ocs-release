ros-hydro-yocs-waypoints-navi (0.5.3-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Added support for YAML-CPP 0.5+.
    The new yaml-cpp API removes the "node >> outputvar;" operator, and
    it has a new way of loading documents. There's no version hint in the
    library's headers, so I'm getting the version number from pkg-config.
    This part of the patch is a port of the ones created by @ktossell for
    map_server and other packages.
    The new yaml-cpp also does not have FindValue.
