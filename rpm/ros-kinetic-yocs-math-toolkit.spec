%description
Math toolkit for Yujin open control system. This package is intended to contain
common use functions, mostly for simple mathematics but also for tf-related
conversions. By no means it pretends to be an efficient and robust, widely used
math library, but a play ground where to put common code that is typically
repeated in many robot control programs.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
